# Refinitiv Data Platform Library for .NET

## Summary

The following series of examples demonstrate how to programmatically access content residing within the **Refinitiv Data Platform (RDP)** using a single, ease of use API called the **Refinitiv Data Platform Library for .NET**.  The platform refers to the layer of data services providing both streaming and non-streaming content serving different clients, from the simple desktop interface to the enterprise application.  

The Refinitiv Data Platform Library for .NET is structured as a stack of interfaces and libraries designed to foster the adoption of our platform by both citizen and professional developers to programmatically access financial content.  Based on this stack of interfaces, the examples defined within this section have been organized as follows:

### **Delivery**

The *Delivery* examples target the interfaces defined within the lowest abstraction layer of the library.  The examples will use different delivery modes such as Streaming, Data, Alert and Bulk services.

### **Content**

The *Content* examples target higher-level abstractions representing financial items like Price, News, Historical Data, etc. The *Content* layer can easily be used by both professional and citizen developers. It provides great flexibility for commonly used financial objects.
